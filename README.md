# Hi, I'm Scott, and I love creating useful things! ðŸ”®

I'm a Frontend Web Developer specializing in highly functional, pixel-perfect web applications, who is currently looking to join a team as a Junior Developer.

My interest in web development started when I decided to make an app for filmmakers â€” turns out I was able to learn web development from scratch and caught the coding bug!

Fast-forward to today, and I've completed a breadth of web development courses at <a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/ccsf-catalog/courses-by-department/computer-networking-and-information-technology" target="_blank">CCSF</a>. My main focus these days is building up my experience collaborating with teams.

In my free time I enjoy tinkering and building things, as well as producing videos for YouTube.

I enjoy staying in practive with web dev fundamentals by hand-coding HTML, CSS, and JS sites. I've also been diving into the React ecosystem, picking up some TypeScript knowledge, and exploring Tailwind.
