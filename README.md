## Hi, I'm Scott, and I love creating useful things!

I'm a Frontend Web Developer specializing in highly functional, pixel-perfect web applications, who is currently looking to join a team as a Junior Developer.

My interest in web development started when I decided to make an app for filmmakers â€” turns out I was able to learn web development from scratch and caught the coding bug!

Fast-forward to today, and I've completed a breadth of web development courses at CCSF. My main focus these days is building up my experience collaborating with teams.

In my free time I enjoy tinkering and building things, as well as producing videos for YouTube.
